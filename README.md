# NYC-public-school-SAT-performance
Use data manipulation and summary statistics to analyze test scores across New York City's public schools!

# Project Instructions
Create a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools containing the "school_name" and "average_math" score for all schools where the results are at least 80% of the maximum possible score, sorted by "average_math" in descending order.
Identify the top 10 performing schools based on scores across the three SAT sections, storing as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the school name and a column named "total_SAT", with results sorted by total_SAT in descending order.
Locate the NYC borough with the largest standard deviation for "total_SAT", storing as a DataFrame called largest_std_dev with "borough" as the index and three columns: "num_schools" for the number of schools in the borough, "average_SAT" for the mean of "total_SAT", and "std_SAT" for the standard deviation of "total_SAT". Round all numeric values to two decimal places.
